Alright, now that you've watched the tutorial to do the hack, and still confused, you've come over to me, @HACKr69420. 
Basically you click on the hack you want, for example, "global"
Say you want the tokens, so you click on "addTokens.js"
You see on these letters and numbers and symbols, your brain is telling you to just leave, that it's too complicated. It's really not tho
You click on the copy symbol then in the blooket market, type "javascript:" and the stuff you copied in your google chrome search bar. 
**MUST BE GOOGLE CHROME
For the coin hack you would put "javascript:async function getName(authToken) {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.blooket.com/api/users/verify-token?token=JWT+' + authToken);
    const data = await response.json();

    return data.name
};

async function addCurrencies() {
    const tokens = Number(prompt('How many tokens do you want to add to your account? (500 daily)'));
    const myToken = localStorage.token.split('JWT ')[1];

    if (tokens > 500) {
        alert('You can only add up to 500 tokens daily.')
    }

    const response = await fetch('https://api.blooket.com/api/users/add-rewards', {
        method: "PUT",
        headers: {
            "referer": "https://www.blooket.com/",
            "content-type": "application/json",
            "authorization": localStorage.token
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            addedTokens: tokens,
            addedXp: 300,
            name: await getName(myToken)
        })
    });

    if (response.status == 200) {
        alert(`${tokens} tokens and 300 XP added to your account!`);
    } else {
        alert('An error occured.');
    };

};

addCurrencies();"



Look at the comment I posted for a video tutorial
